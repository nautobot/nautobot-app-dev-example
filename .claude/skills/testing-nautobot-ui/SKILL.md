name: testing-nautobot-ui
description: Use when you need to look at a page of the Nautobot web UI in this repo's dev environment (check it renders, read what is on it, take a screenshot, find console or request errors), or to add or run a Playwright browser test. Both run through `invoke playwright`, in the `playwright` compose service or on the host.

# Looking at and testing the Nautobot UI with Playwright

Two jobs. Looking at a page needs no code. Writing a test uses the framework in
`nautobot_dev_example/tests/integration/`.

## Look at a page

```bash
invoke playwright --look /dcim/devices/
```

Prints a report of that page, logged in as `admin`: status, title, headings, console errors and
warnings, failed or 4xx/5xx requests, the visible text (first 4000 characters; raise
`NAUTOBOT_PLAYWRIGHT_LOOK_CHARS` for more), and the path of a full-page screenshot under
`screenshots/`. It only logs in and reads: no API token, nothing changed on the instance, so it
is safe against a shared or public Nautobot too (`--url`, `--username`, `--password`). Open the
screenshot and look at it. `screenshots/` is gitignored and persists across runs; a repeat of
the same path overwrites its file. This is the first thing to reach for when
asked whether a page renders, what it shows, or why it looks wrong. "Take a screenshot of
/dcim/devices/" is the same command; show the screenshot and skip the rest of the report.

If the page must be clicked into or changed before the screenshot, use a scratch test (below)
instead.

## Screenshot or inspect a page in a specific state

`--look` only opens a URL. When the page must be in some state first (a button clicked, a tab
open, a form filled, a modal showing), or the report does not answer the question (read one
element), write a short scratch test that gets the page into that state and then takes the
screenshot. Put it in `nautobot_dev_example/tests/scratch/`, which is gitignored and outside the
suite, so it never sits next to the shipped tests and never runs with them. The framework
fixtures are all there: a logged-in page (`auth_page`), the instance URL (`base_url`), a REST
client (`api`) and record cleanup (`create_object`). The debug toolbar is already off. Only
`api` and `create_object` need a token; a test that just reads the page runs against any
instance with a login.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import expect


def test_scratch_device_tab(auth_page, base_url):
    # No UUID to hand: open the list and follow the first row's link.
    auth_page.goto(f"{base_url}/dcim/devices/")
    first_link = auth_page.locator("table tbody tr a").first
    expect(first_link).to_be_visible()
    first_link.click()

    auth_page.get_by_role("tab", name="Interfaces").click()
    expect(auth_page.locator("table tbody tr").first).to_be_visible()

    auth_page.screenshot(path="screenshots/scratch-device-tab.png", full_page=True)
    # Or just one element: auth_page.get_by_role("dialog").screenshot(path=...)
    print(auth_page.url)
```

The selectors above are examples; take the real ones from a `--look` run of the page. With a
UUID, go straight there: `auth_page.goto(f"{base_url}/dcim/devices/{uuid}/")`. To find one by
name, use `api.get("/api/dcim/devices/", params={"name": "..."}).json()["results"][0]["id"]`
(needs a token).

Run it with `invoke playwright --scratch --pattern device_tab` (`--pattern` is pytest `-k`;
print output is on for scratch runs), then open the PNG and look at it. If a step fails, the
run still leaves a failure screenshot under `test-results/`; read that to see how far it got,
before the next run clears it. Do not write standalone Playwright scripts, and nothing goes in
a temporary directory outside the repository: everything runs through `invoke playwright`, and
screenshots go under `screenshots/`.

### Another user, or no login

Every page starts from the session login: `admin`, or whatever `--username` and `--password`
set for the whole run. For one test as a different user, or with no login at all, override the
context args on the test. `base_url` and the toolbar header stay; only the saved login goes.

```python
import pytest
from nautobot.playwright.helpers import log_in


@pytest.mark.browser_context_args(storage_state=None)
def test_scratch_as_other_user(page):
    log_in(page, "someuser", "somepassword")  # drop this line for a logged-out page
    page.goto("/dcim/devices/")
```

For several users in one test, take `new_context` instead of `page` and call it once per user,
logging each page in. The override has to be the marker: `new_context(storage_state=None)`
raises `TypeError`, because pytest-playwright passes the session args and yours as two keyword
sets. The user must already exist on the instance. A fixture that creates one with chosen
permissions is a core follow-up.

## Write a browser test

Browser tests are pytest tests built on the fixtures and page objects Nautobot ships in
`nautobot.playwright` (3.3 or later). The developer guide is `docs/dev/playwright.md`; read it
before writing a test. Tests live in `nautobot_dev_example/tests/integration/`, page objects in
a `pages/` module there, shared fixtures in a `conftest.py` there. Use `expect` for anything on the page,
`assert` for Python values, and `expect(...).not_to_*` for negative checks.

`invoke playwright` runs the suite. Like every other task it follows `local` in `invoke.yml`:

- `local` false (default): pytest runs in the `playwright` compose service, which carries the
  browsers, Nautobot and this app, and reaches the development stack at `http://nautobot:8080`.
- `local` true: pytest runs on the host. Needs `poetry install --with playwright` and
  `poetry run playwright install chromium`. Headed mode works only here.

```bash
invoke playwright                              # whole suite
invoke playwright --pattern create             # tests whose name contains "create"
invoke playwright --marker behavioral          # one pytest mark
invoke playwright --url http://host.docker.internal:8080   # a Nautobot on the host machine
```

## Gotchas

- **The instance does not need Nautobot 3.3.** The default development stack works. Only the
  process running pytest needs `nautobot.playwright` (3.3 or later). The `playwright` image
  installs it from `playwright_nautobot_ver` in `invoke.yml`, `next` by default.
- **Rebuilding the playwright image** takes `invoke build --playwright`. Plain `invoke build`
  skips it, and `invoke playwright` builds it only when its tag is missing.
- **The dev stack must be running** (`invoke start`). Ask the user to start it, or for a `--url`
  to another instance, rather than starting it yourself: `invoke start` builds images. The
  `playwright` service itself does not need to be up: `invoke playwright` starts a one-off
  container when it is not.
- After `page.goto(...)`, wait for the element you will read or screenshot, for example
  `expect(page.locator("table tbody tr").first).to_be_visible()`. List rows arrive through htmx
  after the page frame. Do not use `wait_for_load_state("networkidle")`: pages with Select2
  fields or polling never reach it.
- Never hardcode the host or port. Build URLs from `base_url`.
- In a full-page screenshot the left sidebar ends partway down. It is fixed to the window, and
  full-page capture cuts fixed elements. Not a layout bug. Against the public demo site, the
  Aha feedback and LinkedIn requests fail on every page; that is the debug-toolbar header meeting
  third-party CORS, not the app.
- `test-results/` holds only failure traces and screenshots, and pytest clears it at the start of
  every session. `screenshots/` is where `--look` and scratch tests write, and it is kept.
  Both are gitignored. On Linux a container run writes them as root.
